# How to use Datadog on Heroku

## What is Heroku?

Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that helps developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. The platform is great to develop application as it manages hardware and servers, thereby letting developers focus on developing the application.

## What is Datadog?

Datadog is a monitoring and security platform for cloud applications. It provides, end-to-end traces, metrics, and logs to make applications, infrastructures, and third-party services entirely observable. It can monitor services such as servers, databases and tools and thus, aids in securing the system and avoiding downtime.

## Learning Objective

To be able to determine the performance metrics and monitor events for infrastructure and cloud services. We will be first creating an application on Heroku and then using Datadog to analyse our application. The intended objective of this tutorial is to provide a deep understanding of how the Datadog application can be used to analyse and monitor the application and find any weakness.

## Flow of Tutorial - 

1. Install dependencies
2. Create a Heroku account
3. Create your own website on Heroku
4. Create an account on Datadog
5. Understand how Datadog is used to monitor and analyse applications on Heroku
